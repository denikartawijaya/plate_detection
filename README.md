# Plate Detection Using Google Gemini API and OCR
This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to detect and process license plate data from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) combined with the Google Gemini API for enhanced text description.

**#Prerequisites**

Python Libraries
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
- google-generativeai: For integrating with the Gemini API.
- pillow: For image manipulation and preprocessing.
- pytesseract: For text extraction using OCR.
Install the dependencies with:

**#API Key Configuration**

Obtain an API key from Google Cloud.
Configure the API key in the script to interact with the Gemini API.

**#How It Works**

Preprocess the Image:
1. Images are converted to grayscale to improve OCR performance.
2. Extract Text from Image:
pytesseract is used to read the license plate number from the image.
3. Enhance Text with Gemini API:
The extracted text is sent to the Gemini API for context-aware enhancement, such as adding vehicle type, color, and timestamp information.


**#Notebook Sections**
1. Setup:
Install and import necessary libraries.
Configure the API key.
2. Image Preprocessing:
Load and preprocess the image to improve OCR accuracy.
3. Text Extraction:
Extract raw text (e.g., license plate numbers) from images using OCR.
Text Enhancement:
4. Use the Gemini API to generate a detailed description of the detected text.
5. Output Example:
Display the detected plate number and the enhanced text.
